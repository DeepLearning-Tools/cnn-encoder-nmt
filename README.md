# cnn-encoder-nmt

This is a PyTorch tutorial for the ACL'17 paper [**A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation**](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P17/P17-1012.pdf) accepted as part of the NIPS Workshop on [**Learn How to Code A Paper with State of the Art Frameworks**](https://mltrain.cc/events/nips-highlights-learn-how-to-code-a-paper-with-state-of-the-art-frameworks/)

This repository includes

* [IPython Notebook of the tutorial](https://github.com/pravarmahajan/cnn-encoder-nmt/blob/master/cnn_encoder_nmt.ipynb)
* [Poster](https://github.com/pravarmahajan/cnn-encoder-nmt/blob/master/NIPS_MLTrain_poster.pdf) which gives a high level overview of the paper (We would still recommend you to read the original paper for more details)

### Installation

(NOTE: We have tested only on Python>=3.5, but it should probably work for python 2.7)

The best(and easiest) way to install pytorch is via the [pytorch webpage](http://pytorch.org/)

For other dependencies, run

	pip install -r requirements.txt
    

### Start the Tutorial

	jupyter notebook
